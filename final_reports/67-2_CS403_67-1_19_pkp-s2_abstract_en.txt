Currently, accessing the facilities within the Department of Computer Science,
Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University requires prior booking
through a paper-based form. The "CSTU FACILITY BOOKING WEBSITE" project is a
website developed to address these issues, focusing on enabling users to make
bookings easily. This aims to improve the efficiency of the process for accessing the
facilities within the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and
Technology at Thammasat University.
